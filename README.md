Moreover, if you have a new inventory, you can add and edit the inventory at any time. Inventory is stored in the form of file in respective files: Itemlist.txt and ItemPrice.txt

The source code of Super Market Billing System Project in C has been written in C programming language without of the use of any graphics. The code is complete, totally error free. It can be compiled in any of the editors mentioned here: Code::Blocks/VS Code/Atom using GCC compiler. You can directly download the source code from the link provided here.


Super Market Billing System Project Abstract
User Defined Functions Used:
Although graphics have not been used in this project, the application of user defined functions, structures, pointers, DMA and linked lists have been effectively used here. The major user defined functions used in this C project are:
•	print()
•	add_items()
•	delete_items()
•	view_cart()
•	bill()
print() is used to view the list of Inventory available at the store.
add_items() is used to add the required item with required quantity into the shopping cart. This data is stored in a structure using Linked List.
delete_items() is used to remove an already existing item/item added previously from the shopping cart. This operation again is implemented using Linked List.
view_cart() is used to display the items added into the shopping cart. Structure and Linked List operations are implemented here.
bill() is the last function implemented to print the invoice memo with the total amount and total quantity of items purchased along with customer name and customer phone number.
